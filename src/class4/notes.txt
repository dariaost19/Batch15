Operators:
Operators are different symbols that we use to perform operations like addition, extraction we can compare things
 if they are same or one is less or greater than others.
 There are three main types of operators .
 There are :
 1) Arithmetic - use to perform simple math operations (+, -, /, * , % modulus , we use it to calculate the remained)
 2) Relational - we use it to compare quantities.  . work only for primitive variables.
 for example is something is bigger or numbers are same or not, or for two booleans contains same things.

 == -used to check same value , if its same we will get True, if not False.
 != - not equal to. we use it to check if smthg  does not contain the same value.
  >
  <
  >= if the value on the left is greater than the right we will get true or if they are same we will get True.
  <=
  Conditional constructs:
  Used to write conditional  code. If condition is true Java will execute the code otherwise it skips the code.
  How to write IfEsle condition :
  if   ( relational operators)
   {   "condition"
   Any line could be inside {} , you can even write another IF
   }

 3) Logical -

 If i have to test same Variable for multiple conditions i should use IfElse condition.
 If i have multiple conditions and these are dependent  on each other i should use NestedIF condition.
