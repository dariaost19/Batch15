     Why do we use string in Java?
     Strings, which are widely used in Java programming,
     are a sequence of characters. In the Java programming language, strings are objects.
      The Java platform provides the String class to create and manipulate strings.
      Why do we use string?
    Strings are like sentences. They are formed by a list of characters, which is really an "array of characters".
     Strings are very useful when communicating information from the program to the user of the program.
    They are less useful when storing information for the computer to use.
     Boolean data type is used to store the values true and false.
    This data type may be used to store information that allows one of two states, on or off, to be stored.
    The char() function in p5. js is used to convert the given string or number
    value into its corresponding single-character string representation.
