Exception:
Unwanted behaviour in programs which occurs at runtime and makes our programs terminate abruptly.(suddenly)

Exception handling :
Is a mechanism that allows us  avoid runtime errors and  help us to convert complex error messages to something simpler that a normal user can understand .
How we implement exception handling in Java:
We have new keywords and new blocks of code  which allow us to handle exceptions in Java :
Block of code :
1)Try -we write the code which may throw exception
2)Catch - contains a backup code, the code that we want to execute in case of failure. It can alo contain code to simplify the error messages.it will also can contain a code which might
send a notification or an email to the developers or admins in case of errors.
3)Finally - always executed no matter what happens in the try block or the catch block.
We should put a cleanup code inside finally blocks like closing a browser the database connection etc.
Keywords :

4)Throw
5)Throws
