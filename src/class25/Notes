Interface:
What is an interface in Java with example?
An interface is a reference type in Java. It is similar to class. It is a collection of abstract methods.
A class implements an interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface.
Along with abstract methods, an interface may also contain constants, default methods, static methods, and nested types.

Abstract classes should be used primarily for objects that are closely related, whereas interfaces are best suited for providing a common functionality to unrelated classes.
Why we should learn about interfaces ?
when objects a re closely related to each other and there is Is a relationship between classes we should use ABSTRACTION.
when objects are not related to each others when we should implement abstraction with help of INTERFACES.
