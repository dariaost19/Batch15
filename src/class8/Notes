There are 4 types of loops:
1)while
2)while do
3) for
4)enhanced for loop.
Break keyword is used to stop a loop just like the condition that we use inside a loop.
Continue keyword is used to skip all the code written inside the body of the loop.
We should always use break and continue with IF condition.
