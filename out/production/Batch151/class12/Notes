OPP(Object oriented programming)
It is a way to write the code. That follows certain rules and guidelines.
We create classes that have attributes/properties/fields and methods/functions.
Why we need OOP?
1)It simplifies the software development and maintenance(updates, adding new features to the existing code).
2)Code duplication is reduced.
3) It also help us represent something from real life with the help of classes anf objects.


Class: Is a blueprint(plan) or design from which actual real life objects are created.
Computer use class to check what that class can do Scanner scan=new Scanner(System.in)
Scanner is a class. scan is an object of scanner class.
 With the help of object we can use methods from a class we can also use properties from that class.

 Object :
 Objects are created from classes and we can use them to call methods and properties from those classes.

 Inside the class sequence does not matter.
