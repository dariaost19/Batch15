Polymorphism:
allows us to perform same actions in different ways.
There are 2 types of Polymorphism: static binding compile, late binding

Polymorphism that is achieved with the help of overloading is called early binding or compile  Polymorphism.
Polymorphism that is achieved with the help of overriding is called run time Polymorphism.
Polymorphism allows us to write less code and call multiple methods.

Polymorphism Syntax :
1) for Static we only need to overload.
2)for Dynamic we need to extend from a class we need to override the method from parent class that we want to use in Polymorphism.

Final Keyword:
There are 3 main uses of creating  Final keyword :
1)When you use it with variable you can not change the value what was assigned to it.
2) When we have  created a constants then we declare the variables as final.
3)when we use it with a class no other can inherit from that class

class 02/12/2023 Abstraction :

Abstraction is a process of hiding implementation details and showing only the functionality to user.
Why we should use Abstraction :
1) It reduces the code  complexity .
2) It allows the end user to focus on using the features instead of worrying about implementation.
Syntax :
 We need to declare the methods as abstract if we are not planning to provide implementation.
 We also need to write Abstract keyword with class as well.
