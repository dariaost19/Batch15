Logical operators :
just another set of symbols that we can use to combine multiple boolean operators.
There are 3 logical operators:
! - not operator . is used to negate the boolean values.If something is true it will make it false , and if something is false it will make it true.
|| (above enter +shift) - or
& - and

we can simplify the logic if we use these operators.
What is the Syntax:
they only work with BOOLEAN !
if(! condition)
if(condition1 || condition2)
if(condition1 && condition2)
|| OR logical operator
it combine two or more conditions and returns true  as long as at least one of the condition is true.
false will be only if everything is False!

Logical && operator (And)
it can also combine 2 or more conditions . it only returns true if all the conditions are True.
