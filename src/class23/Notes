Method-overriding :
happens only when method with different implementation exist and child class.

Why should we override?
1)Flexibility
2) we can modify the methods

Rules:
1) private and constructors cant be overridden(since they do not participate in inheritance)
2) if we want to override something we must re- create that exact method inside the child class and can have different implementation.
only access modifier can be changed . it can can have more visibility that the method inside the parent class.

Note :
1) Create constructor : in class right click choose Generate -> select Constructor->shift ->select All -> Ok
2)If we press Ctrl + o we get an option to Override the available methods.
