Set:
Sets do not allow duplicates values.There are three main types of sets  : 1)HashSet,  2)LinkedHashSet,  3)TreeSet

HashSet(most widely used):
upside: speed
downside: it does not maintain insertion order.

LinkedHashSet:
upside: maintain insertion order
downside: slower than HashSet

TreeSet:
upside: keeps the data organized, sorted
downside: it is slower than others.

Map(data structure):

Maps allow us to store data in the form of key value pairs. Just like Sets we have three main types of Maps :  1) HashMap, 2) LinkedHashMap, 3)TreeMap

HashMap(most widely used):
upside: speed
downside: it does not maintain insertion order.

LinkedHashMap:
upside: maintain insertion order
downside: slower than HashSet

TreeMap:
upside: keeps the data organized, sorted
downside: it is slower than others.
