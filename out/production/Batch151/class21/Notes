Super keyword is used to refer to the parent class members like fields methods and constructors.
When should we use Super or This keyword:
when ever same name field or method exist inside the parent and child class, we can use super keyword to explicitly refer to parent class variables methods and constructors.
By default Java will give priority to local variable , if there are no local it will look for instance variable, if there are no instance on the same class , java will look for parent
class instance variable.
Method Overloading :
happens when same name method exist within the class with different parameters.
! should change sequence, datatype or adding one more par.!
